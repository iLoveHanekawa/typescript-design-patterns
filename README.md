# GOF Design Patterns in TypeScript

## Motivation

GOF mostly uses SmallTalk and C++ examples. While both are popular languages, TypeScript translations can help a developer to see how he can utilize them in practice.

## What's translated

Each design pattern has a ```Sample Code``` section. I'm only going to translate the code present in these sections. While rest of the code present in the book is extremely crucial to learning, its mostly pseudocode so a lot of classes are missing their corresponding definitions.   

## Note

TypeScript or JavaScript, in comparison, resembles SmallTalk more than C++. Anyone reading the book should go through the SmallTalk examples with more attention.
